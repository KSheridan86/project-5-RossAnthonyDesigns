## Description
---------------------------------------

RossAnthonyDesigns - ForgedNature is a fully functional E-Commerce store built in Django using Python, JavaScript, CSS, Bootstrap5, HTML and it incorporates stripe payments.
The site provides role based permissions for users to interact with a central dataset. It includes user authentication and Full CRUD functionality for products.

Forged Nature is a small craft business based in Co. Westmeath.
Specializing in hand forged, nature inspired items for display in home or garden.
With products ranging from a simple Butterfly to life size predatory Barn Owls.

This version has been built for project 5 of the Code Institute Diploma in Software Development and therefore doesn't accept real payments and any orders made won't be fulfilled.

But a fully operational live site will be released soon under the url: www.rossanthonydesigns.ie

If you would like to test the payment functionality please feel free to do so by entering the card details below when prompted:

`Card number: 4242 4242 4242 4242  Exp: any future date eg. 11/26 CVC: any 3 digits eg 123`

### Wireframe mock-ups
---
Home page: 

The home page provides the user with a clear understanding as to the purpose of the site. 

The welcome message is clearly visable to the user when they first arrive at the site regardless of the device they are using.

![Home Page Wireframe](./docs/home-wireframe.jpg)


Shop Page:

Users have the ability to view information on available products and add them to a cart for purchase. 

The emphasis of the design is to provide a clear layout that can adapt to any size device.

Users will have the ability to order products by price, Asc & Desc. 

To aid in the user experience users have the ability to open up a seperate page on each item for sale.

![Shop Wireframe](./docs/shop-wireframe.jpg)


Artist Page:

Users can view a page dedicated to the artist himself, this page includes basic information and photos, aswell as a contact form used for basic communication or requests for commissions.

![Artist Wireframe](./docs/artist-wireframe.jpg)


Cart Page:

Users can view a cart with their chosen items, it includes a total price for items in the cart, delivery cost and grand total (price + delivery)

![Cart Wireframe](./docs/cart-wireframe.jpg)


Checkout Page:

The checkout page will include a summary of items in the cart and all relevant information needed for a successful order ie. Contact Details, Delivery Details & Payment Details.

![Checkout Wireframe](./docs/checkout-wireframe.jpg)


Site Footer:

The Footer is responsive and universal across the site, it includes a newsletter signup form, contact information and social media links.

![Footer Wireframe](./docs/footer-wireframe.jpg)


Wireframes were also produced for each major page for both mobile and tablet devices. 
With the intention of the site being fully responsive so that no matter the device size the user is viewing the site on, it will display accordingly.

## Database Schema

Several custom models were predicted to be required when building the site. On top of the standard Sculpture/Order models these included a Newsletter signup Model a Message Model and a customer Review model. The database schema was drawn out by hand.

![Database Schema Diagram](./docs/database-schema.jpg)

Once I was happy with the overall structure of the site, and the layout of the wireframes, I selected the colour scheme. The colour schemes were checked for colour contrast to ensure that the appropriate colours were used for a high level of colour contrast to maximise accessibility for users.

These colours were:

Grey/Blue: #6f8ca2

Dusty Orange: #ff85436b

Whitesmoke: #f5f5f5

And Bootstraps Text-Muted class for sligtly greyed out text.

## Agile Development

The plan for this project was carried out using the Agile Methodology in Github. User Stories were created using issues on git hub. Each user story explicitly explains the purpose of the issues. Each user story is segmented into acceptance criteria and tasks. It was prioritised using GitHub labels with different colors.

9 Epics were created which were then further developed into 29 User Stories. The details on each epic, along with the user stories linked to each one can be found in the project kanban board [here](https://github.com/users/KSheridan86/projects/4)

From the Epics, 29 User stories were developed. Each story was assigned a classification of Must-Have, Should-Have, Could-Have or Won't Have. Each story was also assigned user story points, based on my best estimation for the time/difficulty of completing each story. In practice some of these tasks were completed much quicker than anticipated and others took a little longer but overall the development went smoother than anticipated and the project was completed ahead of schedule. A number of these stories were chosen to be left out of the project as it was already quite big (I.E social media login).

## Web Marketing

#### **E-Commerce Application Type**
Forged Nature is a B2C e-commerce application. Selling directly to consumers means that the site is designed to sell quickly, on impulse, and in smaller quantities aswell as cater to people who may wish to commission a piece. While wholesale is a possible future goal, the website was not yet intended to sell to other businesses. For this reason, a large amount of the functionality is focused on the user experience and the ability to purchase products quickly and effectively

#### **Marketing Strategy**
As Forged Nature is a start-up business, the budget for marketing is limited. However, there are several ways that Forged Nature can market itself to help increase sales and brand awareness. Using Facebook to pump out content and drive traffic is the first and most straightforward. The use of paid ads allows the business to target specific demographics and increase brand awareness. The use of social media is also a great way to get feedback from customers and to help with customer service. There is an image of the Facebook page below and a link to the page [here](https://www.facebook.com/forged.nature.irl).

The second is the use of google ads which are a great way to increase brand awareness and help with SEO. The use of google ads can also help with the use of long-tail keywords and help with the ranking of the site.

The third is the use of influencers. Influencers are a great way to increase brand awareness. Free samples could be sent to popular influencers on youtube in exchange for a mention/hashtag/ link in the description. This further helps raise brand awareness because the video could be posted on Facebook and the influencer tagged in the post, which with the help of the Facebook algorithm, would help bring an organic audience to the Facebook page and, hopefully, the store.

The final method would then be sending regular news letters to the mailing list obtained via the signup form. The newsletter would contain links to recent articles, the latest products, special offers and promotions. This would help with brand awareness building a community around the brand.

#### **Search Engine Optimization**
SEO research is key to driving traffic from a browser based search i.e. Google to the website. The keyword research has played a crucial role in incorporating words that users typically search for when seeking to purchase art online. To help improve the search engine ranking I ensured the site carries meta tags for a description and keywords which encapsulate the general content and focus of this B2C site.

#### **XML Sitemap**
Additionally to help the search engines crawl the website, I've added an XML sitemap file to the main root directory. The file was created using the free service through XML-Sitemaps.com. A sitemap is a way of organizing a website, identifying the URLs and the data under each section. Previously, the sitemaps were primarily geared for the users of the website. However, Google's XML format was designed for the search engines, allowing them to find the data faster and more efficiently.

A robots.txt file has also be included in the build to tell the search engine crawlers which URLs the crawler can access on this site. This is used mainly to avoid overloading the site with requests.

#### **Facebook Page**

#### Home page
A welcoming homepage was built to welcome the user to the site and clearly convey the sites purpose. The call to action buttons for the user to go straight to the shop or contact the site owner is at the top of the main page, just below a large welcome message.

![Home Page](./docs/home-page.png)

#### Navigation Bar
The main navigation bar appears at the top of the page, clearly displaying the main navigational links users would require.

![Nav Bar](./docs/menu.png)


#### Footer
A common footer is utilised throughout the site.
The name ChimpTech.ie is a domain owned by me and in the near future will host my projects and begin to advertise web development services.

## Future Enhancements
There are several items of functionality that I would like to add in the future. I have left the original user stories that were developed in the project kanban board as future enhancement opportunities.
The key areas I would like to add to the site in the future are:

* The ability for users to login via social networks such as google or facebook
* Other payment options ie. Paypal

AllAuth signup:
The templates for allauth have been changed to suit the style of the site but if the user tries to register for an account with an email that is already in the database there are no warning messages,
the page just reloads, therefore the user is unsure of what went wrong, given a little more time I would like to try to find a way to customize the allauth views so as to include error messages when this happens.

## Testing

### Testing Strategy
I utilised a manual testing strategy for the development of the site.
Seperate to the functionality testing of the site, and the testing of the code, User Story tests were implemented to ensure that the criteria of the user stories listed above were met.


#### Testing Overview

Testing was divided into different sections to ensure everything was tested individually with test cases developed for each area.


#### Validator Testing
All code files were validated using suitable validators for the specific language.
HTML & CSS code passed the validation.
JavaScript code produced one warning about an undefined variable but this is nothing to worry about as it is defined in another file.
All validation screenshots are included below.

All HTML validation returned the same result so I have included only 1 screenshot here.
## HTML
![HTML Validation](./docs/HTML-validation.png)
## CSS
![CSS Validation](./docs/CSS-validation.png)
## Script JS
![Script JS](./docs/JS-script.png)
## Stripe JS
![Stripe JS](./docs/JS-stripe.png)
## Quantity Input JS
![Quantity Input JS](./docs/JS-quantity-input.png)


#### Lighthouse Testing
Below you can see the results of Googles Lighthouse Testing.

The desktop results were near perfect but the mobile testing could only produce scores in the low 80's for performance, (all other categories were upwards 0f 90).

The cause of this appeared to be "render blocking resources" & "cache policy".
The "render blocking resources" in question appeared to be Stripe & Bootstrap, I am not sure of how to resolve this issue as those resources are integral to the functionality of the site.
Likewise the cache policy is beyond my grasp, I did a little research on what is needed to fix this and the solution falls outside the realms of this course.

![Lighthouse Testing Desktop](./docs/lighthouse-desktop.png)
![Lighthouse Testing Mobile](./docs/Lighthouse-mobile.png)


#### Python/JavaScript Testing
All Custom Python & JavaScript code was manually tested multiple times during and after development.
This is reflected in the fact that all of the user stories below are working and have produced no errors in the terminal or the console.

## Bugs

Stripe server error:
I noticed that after the site was deployed to Heroku I could not access the checkout page, I would receive a server error message instead.
Turns out it was an easy fix, I had forgotten to include environment variables in Heroku.

CORS warnings in the console:
During testing I noticed that when using Firefox, when I navigate to the payments page, Lots of CORS warnings show up one after the other.
This does not happen on Chrome, I could not find a solution to this but upon further research I came across information that this could just be a Firefox issue and not limited to my app.

Cart Error:
I noticed that even though I limited the amount of items that could be added to the cart to the total quantity available, this could be bypassed by adding items directly from the cart.
This was fixed in the view by first checking the available stock and only adding items if they were available.

Single-item page error:
In the single item page when trying to select a quantity to add to the cart I noticed that on each press of the + button items were being added to the cart before the add to cart button was pushed.
I found that inside the form that handles this functionality if I changed those + and - buttons from button tags to divs the problem resolved, the button was triggering the form as a whole but the div just operates the increment and decrement functionality leaving the user free to add how ever many products they like and then click add to cart. 

Header background:
I noticed in the dev tools that the background for the header was cutting off the bottom of the video element. So I incresed the height until it looked good.
BUT then I noticed that on real tablets that it was much too big, leaving lots of empty space.
In the devtools the tablet setting is the correct width but the height is less than the width and since most people will hold a tablet portrait style when browsing the internet I once again changed the height of the header to fit with this conclusion.

## Deployment

The site was deployed via Heroku, and the live link can be found here - [Forged Nature](https://rossanthonydesigns.herokuapp.com/)

### Project Deployment

To deploy the project through Heroku I followed these steps:
* Sign up / Log in to [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/)
* From the main Heroku Dashboard page select 'New' and then 'Create New App'
* Give the project a name - I entered RossAnthonyDesigns and select a suitable region, then select create app. The name for the app must be unique.
* This will create the app within Heroku and bring you to the deploy tab. From the submenu at the top, navigate to the resources tab.
* Add the database to the app, in the add-ons section search for 'Heroku Postgres', select the package that appears and add 'Heroku Postgres' as the database
* Navigate to the setting tab, within the config vars section copy the DATABASE_URL to the clipboard for use in the Django configuration.
* Within the django app repository create a new file called env.py - within this file import the os library and set the environment variable for the DATABASE_URL pasting in the address copied from Heroku. The line should appear as os.environ["DATABASE_URL"]= "Paste the link in here"
* Add a secret key to the app using os.environ["SECRET_KEY"] = "your secret key goes here"
* Add the secret key just created to the Heroku Config Vars as SECRET_KEY for the KEY value and the secret key value you created as the VALUE
* In the settings.py file within the django app, import Path from pathlib, import os and import dj_database_url
* insert the line if os.path.isfile("env.py"): import env
* remove the insecure secret key that django has in the settings file by default and replace it with SECRET_KEY = os.environ.get('SECRET_KEY')
* replace the databases section with DATABASES = { 'default': dj_database_url.parse(os.environ.get("DATABASE_URL"))} ensure the correct indentation for python is used.
* In the terminal migrate the models over to the new database connection
* Navigate in a browser to cloudinary, log in, or create an account and log in. 
* From the dashboard - copy the CLOUDINARY_URL to the clipboard
* in the env.py file created earlier - add os.environ["CLOUDINARY_URL"] = "paste in the Url copied to the clipboard here"
* In Heroku, add the CLOUDINARY_URL and value copied to the clipboard to the config vars
* Also add the KEY - DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC with the Value - 1 to the config vars
* this key value pair must be removed prior to final deployment
* Add the cloudinary libraries to the list of installed apps, the order they are inserted is important, 'cloudinary_storage' goes above 'django.contrib.staticfiles' and 'cloudinary' goes below it.
* in the Settings.py file - add the STATIC files settings - the url, storage path, directory path, root path, media url and default file storage path.
* Link the file to the templates directory in Heroku TEMPLATES_DIR = os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'templates')
* Change the templates directory to TEMPLATES_DIR - 'DIRS': [TEMPLATES_DIR]
* Add Heroku to the ALLOWED_HOSTS list the format will be the app name given in Heroku when creating the app followed by .herokuapp.com
* In your code editor, create three new top level folders, media, static, templates
* Create a new file on the top level directory - Procfile
* Within the Procfile add the code - web: gunicorn PROJECT_NAME.wsgi
* In the terminal, add the changed files, commit and push to GitHub
* In Heroku, navigate to the deployment tab and deploy the branch manually - watch the build logs for any errors.
* Heroku will now build the app for you. Once it has completed the build process you will see a 'Your App Was Successfully Deployed' message and a link to the app to visit the live site.

#### Forking the repository
By forking the GitHub Repository you can make a copy of the original repository to view or change without it effecting the original repository
This can be done by
* Log into GitHub or create an account.
* Locate the repository at https://github.com/KSheridan86/project-5-RossAnthonyDesigns .
* At the top of the repository, on the right side of the page, select "Fork" from the buttons available.
* A copy of the repository should now be created in your own repository.

#### Create a clone of this repository
Creating a clone enables you to make a copy of the repository at that point in time - this lets you run a copy of the project locally:
This can be done by:
* Navigate to https://github.com/KSheridan86/project-5-RossAnthonyDesigns
* click on the arrow on the green code button at the top of the list of files
* select the clone by https option and copy the URL it provides to the clipboard
* navigate to your code editor of choice and within the terminal change the directory to the location you want to clone the repository to.
* type 'git clone' and paste the https link you copied from github
* press enter and git will clone the repository to your local machine
