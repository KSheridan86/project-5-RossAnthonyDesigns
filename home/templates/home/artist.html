                    Continually evolving but always focused on realism, I transform sheets of metal into vibrant
                    manifestations of the human, animal and natural form.
                    The process of manipulating steel is not planned but rather instinctive;
                    the figure springs forth from the imagination, the textures, shapes and colorations coming
                    together as I hammer, grind and weld each component.
                    I follow no guide or single school of technique, allowing my creativity and multiple
                    metalworking disciplines to come together as needed.
                    Fluid movement is always present, whether shown in muscle texture,
                    wind or water currents.
                    Each piece is inspired by the vivid beauty I witness every day, the completion is a testament
                    to the rich material I draw on.
                    Through the study of form and function, the practice of exploring the elements of the
                    raw materials I work with, and a desire to always elevate the craftsmanship of my art, each
                    sculpture grows and moves in its own way.
